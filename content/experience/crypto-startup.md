I started my career as a frontend dev. at my friend's crypto startup. The project's goal was to give analytics for investors. Devs chose React/Redux and since I was already experienced in vanilla JavaScript I quickly began to commit small tasks. It was a time mostly consisted of a learning race, not because of FOMO, but rather because of curiosity.
