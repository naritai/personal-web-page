Contract job on a project Cedrus Data - distributed SQL query engine based on Trino.
Starting from scratch, I built frontend architecture in Feature Slice Design style + add variety of tests, but integration tests mostly. I managed to build the first iteration of SQL Editor with data query support and results viewer.
