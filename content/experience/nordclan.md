Iâ€™ve been working on a CRM system for a company producing electric and thermal energy. The product is focused around inspecting/logging equipment parts to support reliability, detect equipment quality of work, analyze data in charts, make detours in a factory. The main goal is to improve efficiency for detours and inspection of the equipment.
