At Nord Clan I had the chance to meet clever and interesting people with a great sense of humor (thanks God). In addition, there was an interesting project, a CRM system for a company producing electric and thermal energy. It was a huge project, written in React/Redux stack, and a wide field for refactoring. I revamped a ton of components, tables, charts, monstrous reducers, and stayed alive. 🏄🏻‍♂️
