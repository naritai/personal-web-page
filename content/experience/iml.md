IML Express is the first big company where I worked as a frontend dev. There I had the opportunity to learn from experienced professionals. I was working on an in-house fulfillment system for which I developed most of the mobile screens. Additionally, I refactored many of old components to make them simple and clean, which improved the overall performance and user experience.
