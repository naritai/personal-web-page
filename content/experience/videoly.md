Videoly automatically connect videos to online stores' product pages.

I was responsible for developing the core customer-facing product - Videoly Widget. For 2 years I've been working with 2 versions of the widget (legacy & new), backend, chrome extension, BS auto-tests, and other parts of Videoly project. It was a great responsibility for me to completely rebuild the widget with the new stack. I'm really proud of our success - new widget is successfully running now in production üèÜ
