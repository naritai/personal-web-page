At Videoly I was responsible for developing the core customer-facing product - Videoly Widget. 
Most of the time I developed the brand new widget. The initial project, written in vanilla JavaScript, was full of code couplings and tricky staff, so it was a great time for developing Sherlock's intuition. Alongside new widget development, I fixed bugs and implemented new features in the production widget, worked with the backend, videoly chrome extension, browserstack, and other parts of the Videoly project. In the end I rebuilt the widget in new stack and widget team ran it in production. I'm really proud of it. üèÜ
